# Introduction

## Welcome to Cel.ai

Cel.ai is a powerful Python framework designed to accelerate the development of omnichannel virtual assistants. Whether you need to integrate with platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, or VoIP services such as VAPI.com, Cel.ai provides the tools and flexibility to get your assistant up and running quickly.

## Key Components

### Connectors
Cel.ai comes with out-of-the-box support for several popular platforms:

However, you can also create your own assistant using the framework or any LLM model of your choice.

### Middlewares
Cel.ai supports the use of middlewares to extend and customize the functionality of your virtual assistants. This allows for greater flexibility and control over how your assistant processes and responds to user interactions.
